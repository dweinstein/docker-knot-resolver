# SYNOPSIS

DNS-over-TLS configuration to use cloudflare via [knot-resolver](https://github.com/CZ-NIC/knot-resolver) project docker container.

## How it works

We use the [knot-resolver](https://www.knot-resolver.cz/) project.

The [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) is using an ["official"](https://hub.docker.com/r/cznic/knot-resolver/) docker container image built by the open source project.

We specify a TLS policy in the [config.docker](config.docker):

## Metrics
Since we're using knot-resolver under the hood we can access some metrics from the service:

![metrics](./docs/metrics.png?raw=true "knot-resolver dns metrics")


## Mac OS

After running the container, set the ip of the container host as the DNS entry

![Set DNS on Mac OS](./docs/macos-config.png?raw=true "Set DNS on Mac OS")

## Testing it works

One easy way to test that things are working is to use tcpdump on the host that is performing the DNS resolution (the one hosting the container).

```sh
% sudo tcpdump udp port 53
```

Now we watch to make sure there are no outbound DNS requests. We should only see an inbound DNS lookup request from the host you're testing from.when you're testing).

## Debugging knot-resolver

Try looking at logs and attaching to the docker container:

Set the knot-resolver container to verbose using: `verbose(true)` either at the end of [`config.docker`](config.docker) or by attaching to the container `docker attach kresd` and typing `verbose(true)` at the prompt. `help()` will get you more info at the REPL.
